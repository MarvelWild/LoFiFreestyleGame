# Wild World 2
Freestyle/multiplayer/sandbox/experimental game written with [LÖVE ](https://love2d.org/)


Influenced by Sketch Tales, World of Warcraft, Minecraft, Don't Starve, Realm of the Mad God, Atari 2600 games.

Current state: early development

I decided to rewrite from scratch for better code and easier development.
